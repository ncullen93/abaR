# Automated biomarker analysis in R (abaR)

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of abaR is to make it easier to fit statistical models on permuatations
of covariates / predictors / outcomes / groups, to make it easier to investigate how biomarkers can be used to plan (screening / enirichment) and analyze clinical trials, and to facilitate multi-cohort validation studies when data cannot be easily shared between collaborators.

The abaR package is based on tidyverse principles, which is why it features a workflow heavily based on the pipe ( %>% ) operator. This lets you analyze data in a manner which is more similar to the way we talk and think about biomarker analysis.

## Installation

You can install the development version from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/ncullen93/abaR) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ncullen93/abaR")
```

## Example: statistical analysis

The general workflow of fitting an aba model for statistical analysis looks like this:

``` r
model <- aba_model() %>% 
  set_groups(
    #DX_bl == 'CU',
    #DX_bl == 'MCI',
    #DX_bl %in% c('CU', 'MCI')
  ) %>% 
  set_outcomes(
    #MMSE_4y:ADAS_4y
  ) %>% 
  set_covariates(
    #AGE, SEX, EDUCATION
  ) %>% 
  set_predictors(
    #ABETA, TAU, NFL,
    #c(ABETA, TAU,)
  )
  
```
