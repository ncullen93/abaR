## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed redundnat "in R" from title and description

* Rewrote description to not start with "This package", etc

* Added missing \value to .Rd file for aba_plot function

* Replaced \dontrun{} with \donttest{} where relevant

* Removed files from vignettes/examples/ folder which had specific paths

* Replaced 'options(warn = -1)' with 'suppresWarnings()' where relevant


## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.
